Please feel free to use our designs, code, and strategies to better your team, or to inspire your ideas. 
Vex is not only a competition but a community and by helping one another we can keep our community positive and growing 
Plus, we hate it when others hate on other hard work, or put them down for lack of skill. Don't be like that, share your knolege and you will feel ten times better than winning the competition
If you do use something from here, please mention us, does not have to be much just a little note in the log book or something. Just don't be that person who takes others' ideas for their own.
